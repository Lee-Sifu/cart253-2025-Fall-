I really enjoyed checking out my peers Art Jam piece's. It immediately caught my attention because of how much personality and interactivity they brought into it. 
For Ash's work where you can draw on the screen is really creative and a good user interaction.
The idea of creating an alternate version of yourself that combines real-life traits with the things you love is such a clever and creative approach to a self-portrait. I could clearly see how Ash mixed realistic elements, like human features and piercings, with expressive, stylized touches that made it feel like a digital alter ego. 
The things you’re passionate about like cats, stars, and those lined patterns added such a personal and charming touch that made the piece easy to connect with. I also loved how you give users a digital self makeup and eyeliner that can change. 

For Olivia's art jam, the interactive elements were a standout for me. Being able to click to make your character blink was such a fun idea. She gave her artwork a real sense of life and made me feel like I was genuinely engaging with her digital self. The fact that you can give your character a clown nose using the mouse was hilarious and so creative. It shows her sense of humor and willingness to keep things playful. At first when the background was being filled up I thought it would go faster if you pressed the mouse when making the eyes glow. 
From a technical standpoint, it’s awesome that Olivia experimented with bezier() for the first time to create the eyes. I never considered that function for my own, but she used it really well giving the self portrait expressive, organic shapes that feel full of emotion.

Matia's work is also really good it reminds me from mine where we both have our face change expression base on mouse position.
I also noticed how he worked mouseX and mouseY into the interactivity, along with line() to add structure and movement to the piece. It’s clear that Matia pushed himself to explore new coding functions and combined them creatively.
Also the changing background color really makes the canvas feel alive compared to just a static background. When looking at his code I really like how he utilized push() and pop() in every function, which showcases his understanding from the class and professor's teaching.

Their work feels incredibly personal, vibrant, and full of character. What stands out most is how it invites others to engage and leave their own imprint it’s like meeting a digital version of you that’s open, playful, and constantly growing.

They’ve done a fantastic job blending emotion, design, and interactivity into a single, cohesive experience that lingers in your mind. The interactive elements make the piece feel truly alive.

It’s clear that careful thought went into not just the visual design, but also the feeling of engagement. The final results are beautifully combined with technical understranding with personal storytelling in a way that feels both intimate and inspiring.
