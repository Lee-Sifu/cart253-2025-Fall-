Frog will start off as small (when frog eat flies over time it will grow)
Frog will change color over time (each color symbolises its evolution growth)
Frog will have tongue control to eat flies.
More than one type of fly (good fly that nourishes the frog but bad fly will hurt frog)
Add a score system (+1 for each good fly, -1 for each bad fly)
Give players missions(ex. frog eats 5 flies at first. Then # of flies being eaten increase as player progresses)
Maybe add a timer to give players a push to complete their task
Add a special fly that give bonus points (ex. +5)
Frog has life points (if frog dies, its game over. Bad fly hurts frog besides loosing score points)
Frog might have a different mode (if frog eats a certain amount of flies within a certain time frame, it will have a special ability like slow-mo)
