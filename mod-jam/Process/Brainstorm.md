Frog will start off as small (when frog eat flies over time it will grow)

Frog will change color over time (each color symbolises its evolution growth)

5.Frog will have tongue control to eat flies. (tongue will have a certain length. Mouse function to move and activate tongue)

More than one type of fly (good fly that nourishes the frog but bad fly will hurt frog)

Add a score system (+1 for each good fly, -1 for each bad fly)

3.Give players missions(ex. frog eats 5 flies at first. Then # of flies being eaten increase as player progresses)

4.Add levels (once frog finishes missions, a new canvas scene appears)

Frog will return as small in each level (give players a fresh start after each level)

2.Maybe add a timer to give players a push to complete their task

Add a special fly that give bonus points (ex. +5)

Frog has life points (if frog dies, its game over. Bad fly hurts frog besides loosing score points)

Frog might have a different mode (if frog eats a certain amount of flies within a certain time frame, it will have a special ability like slow-mo)

1.Add score point visual (When frog eats, points show up around the frog)

Give frog a facial expression (If frog looses it shows a sad face or if frog wins it shows a happy face)

Add sound to frog (frog will have tongue sound when eating flies)

Add sound to flies (good flies and bad flies will both have a distinct sound)

Add different types of sounds to frog (ex. fly give frog different appetizer sound at random)

Give frog different obstacles (After each level, flies radomly spawn at different angles plus added blocks to contrain the frog's tongue shot)

Frog gives different comments to you (If frog wins, it will tell you "Good job!" or if frog looses it will say "Better luck next time")

Each level difficulty increases (Early levels are easy, have more time limit. Later on you receive less good flies and lower time limit)
